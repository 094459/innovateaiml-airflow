# Innovate AI/ML EMEA 2021

### OPS4 - Build your ML platforms using open source technology

### Resources

During this presentation I talked about a few resources to help you get started and configure your Apache Airflow environments. Here are links to these resources.

* [Airflow workshop from Delivery Hero](https://github.com/deliveryhero/pyconde2019-airflow-ml-workshop)- Check out this great starting workshop that was put together by Delivery Hero at PyConde 2019.
* [Running Apache Airflow locally via Docker](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3g) - this is the Docker compose file I showed and started. It mounts a local volume (dags) that you can use to upload DAGs for development.
* [Apache Airflow main page](https://airflow.apache.org/)
* [Machine Learning in Production using Apache Airflow](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2g)
